Work though the documents in this order:
1. getting_started_bacmann


`detailed_protocol_bacmann.pdf` contains additional info on how to use Bacmman. 
Note however that this protocol uses the old, classical segmentation and tracking algorithms, and some aspect of the instalation and processing workflow our now out of date.
The parts on visulaisation, selection, and export are still relevant.

This repository contains worksheets and documentations used in the 
"Computational image analysis: transforming images into insights" part 
of the "Spring School Bioinformatics and computational approaches in Microbiology" 
organized by the NCCR AntiResist, NCCR Microbiomes, and the SIB PhD training network.

## Content needed during course
### Project0_Ilastik
Worksheets for the data analysis of Family Machine Experiments using Ilastik and SciKit Image

### Project1_Delta2
Worksheets for the data analysis of Agar Pad Experiments using Delta 2.0


### Project2_Bacmman
Worksheets for the data analysis of Mother Machine Experiments using Bacmman.

Work though the documents in this order:
1. getting_started_bacmann


`detailed_protocol_bacmann.pdf` contains additional info on how to use Bacmman. 
Note however that this protocol uses the old, classical segmentation and tracking algorithms, and some aspect of the installation and processing workflow our now out of date.
The parts on visualization, selection, and export are still relevant.
